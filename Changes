Summary of important user-visible changes for BioPerl-Run
---------------------------------------------------------

{{$NEXT}}

    * The following modules have been moved to the BioPerl
      distribution so that new BioPerl Run tools can be developed
      without being dependent on the whole BioPerl-Run distribution:

          Bio::Tools::Run::Analysis
          Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory
          Bio::Tools::Run::Phylo::PhyloBase
          Bio::Tools::Run::WrapperBase
          Bio::Tools::Run::WrapperBase::CommandExts

    * The following modules have been removed from BioPerl-Run to be
      part of separate distributions and have independent development:

          Bio::Tools::Phylo::Gumby
          Bio::Tools::Run::AssemblerBase
          Bio::Tools::Run::BWA
          Bio::Tools::Run::BWA::Config
          Bio::Tools::Run::Cap3
          Bio::Tools::Run::Meme
          Bio::Tools::Run::Minimo
          Bio::Tools::Run::Newbler
          Bio::Tools::Run::Phrap
          Bio::Tools::Run::Phylo::Gumby

    * New program previously part of the BioPerl distribution:

          bp_blast2tree


1.7.2

* Minor release - PAML, Clustalw, and TCoffee related modules are all

1.6.0 Release

* All Pise and Pise-related modules and scripts have been moved to the new
  bioperl-pise repository. The Pise service is no longer available and has been
  replaced by Mobyle. They have been retained as one can still install a Pise
  server, and as these modules can possibly be used to create a new BioPerl API
  for Mobyle.

1.5.2 Release in sync with bioperl core

* Several wrappers updated for newer versions of the programs.

1.5.1 Release in sync with bioperl core

   o First major release in a while, so lots of things in this release

   o PHYLIP wrappers are updated for PHYLIP 3.6, some programs will no

     point. It will depend on whether or not anyone really wants this
     if we'll add in the necessary stuf to support 3.5.  It isn't
     hard, just requires some stuff in th PhylipConf.pm modules.

   o Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Muscle added

   o PAML wrapper for Yn00 and Codeml are more forgiving about the
     argument validation.
