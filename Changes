1.6.0 Release

* All Pise and Pise-related modules and scripts have been moved to the new
  bioperl-pise repository. The Pise service is no longer available and has been
  replaced by Mobyle. They have been retained as one can still install a Pise
  server, and as these modules can possibly be used to create a new BioPerl API
  for Mobyle.

1.5.2 Release in sync with bioperl core

* Several wrappers updated for newer versions of the programs.

1.5.1 Release in sync with bioperl core

   o First major release in a while, so lots of things in this release

   o PHYLIP wrappers are updated for PHYLIP 3.6, some programs will no
     longer work (DrawTree and DrawGram specifically) for 3.5 at ths
     point. It will depend on whether or not anyone really wants this
     if we'll add in the necessary stuf to support 3.5.  It isn't
     hard, just requires some stuff in th PhylipConf.pm modules.

   o Bio::Tools::Run::Alignment::Muscle added

   o PAML wrapper for Yn00 and Codeml are more forgiving about the
     argument validation.

   o Several wrappers updated for newer versions of the programs.
